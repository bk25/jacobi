This program's purpose is to calculate eigenvectors and values of symmetric matrixes using Jacobi iterration algorythm. 
Expected matrix size and calculation's presicion can be changed at the beging of application. 
Application stores previously selected matrix size and precision in Windows registry and displays them at the start of execution.
